    "## Lesson: Java Collections Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction (Aashray)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview:**  \n",
    "Java Collections are reusable data structures that enable developers to store, retrieve, and manipulate groups of objects efficiently. Instead of manually managing arrays (which have a fixed size and limited operations), the Collections Framework provides ready-to-use implementations (e.g., `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`) with useful methods such as sorting, shuffling, searching, and more. This lesson will introduce the core concepts, key terms, and practical usage with code examples and interactive exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives:**  \n",
    "- Understand what collections are and why we use them.  \n",
    "- Learn the differences between collections and arrays.  \n",
    "- Identify and describe the main types of collection interfaces (List, Set, Queue, Map) and their implementations.  \n",
    "- Learn key methods and how to iterate through collections.  \n",
    "- Try out simple code experiments to reinforce the hands-on concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Key Definitions & Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collection:**  \n",
    "  An object that groups multiple elements into a single unit. Collections can grow and shrink dynamically, and (using generics) are type-safe.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Framework:**  \n",
    "  A set of interfaces, classes, and methods that provide standardized ways to manipulate data structures. In Java, the Collections Framework is found in the `java.util` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generics:**  \n",
    "  A language feature (added in Java 5) that allows a collection to specify the type of its elements, ensuring compile-time type safety and eliminating the need for explicit casts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Interface vs. Implementation:**  \n",
    "  The framework defines interfaces (e.g., `List`, `Set`, `Map`) as blueprints of what operations a collection should offer. Concrete classes (like `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`) implement these interfaces with specific details.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterator:**  \n",
    "  An object for traversing collections one element at a time. There are standard iterators (from the `Iterator` interface) as well as list-specific iterators (`ListIterator`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fail-fast vs. Fail-safe:**  \n",
    "  Iterators from most collections (like those of `ArrayList`) throw a `ConcurrentModificationException` if the collection is modified during iteration (fail-fast). Some concurrent collections (such as those in `java.util.concurrent`) allow modifications during traversal (fail-safe).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Why Use Collections?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages over Arrays:**\n",
    "- **Dynamic sizing:** Unlike arrays, collections automatically grow or shrink to fit the number of elements.\n",
    "- **Predefined methods:** Framework classes provide utility methods like `sort()`, `shuffle()`, `search()`, and many more.\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** Collections support advanced operations (iterators, streams, lambda expressions) and can hold objects of any type (using generics).\n",
    "- **Interoperability:** The framework is designed with standard interfaces so you can switch implementations (for example, from `ArrayList` to `LinkedList`) with minimal changes in your code.\n",
    "- **Thread safety options:** Classes like `ConcurrentHashMap` and utilities (e.g., `Collections.synchronizedList()`) help when developing concurrent applications.\n",

    "### 4. Types of Collections\n",
    "\n",
    "Java Collections fall broadly into two categories: **Collection interfaces** and **Map interfaces**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A. Collection Interfaces\n",
    "These include interfaces that represent groups of objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **List**  \n",
    "   - **Definition:** An ordered collection that allows duplicate elements.\n",
    "   - **Common Implementations:**  \n",
    "     - `ArrayList` (backed by a dynamically resized array; best for random access)  \n",
    "     - `LinkedList` (a doubly linked list; best for frequent insertions/deletions)  \n",
    "   - **Key Methods:** `add()`, `get()`, `set()`, `remove()`, `size()`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Set**  \n",
    "   - **Definition:** A collection that does not allow duplicate elements. Not inherently ordered.\n",
    "   - **Common Implementations:**  \n",
    "     - `HashSet` (unordered, uses hashing for fast lookup)  \n",
    "     - `LinkedHashSet` (preserves insertion order)  \n",
    "     - `TreeSet` (stores elements in sorted order)\n",
    "   - **Key Methods:** `add()`, `contains()`, `remove()`, `size()`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Queue**  \n",
    "   - **Definition:** A collection used to hold multiple elements prior to processing. Typically follows FIFO (first-in-first-out).\n",
    "   - **Common Implementations:**  \n",
    "     - `LinkedList` (can function as a queue)  \n",
    "     - `PriorityQueue` (orders elements by priority)\n",
    "   - **Key Methods:** `offer()`, `poll()`, `peek()`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Deque (Double-Ended Queue)**  \n",
    "   - **Definition:** Supports element insertion and removal at both ends.\n",
    "   - **Common Implementations:**  \n",
    "     - `ArrayDeque`  \n",
    "     - `LinkedList`\n",
    "   - **Key Methods:** `addFirst()`, `addLast()`, `removeFirst()`, `removeLast()`\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### B. Map Interfaces\n",
    "Unlike the collection interfaces above, a **Map** stores key-value pairs. Note that Map is not a subtype of Collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Map**  \n",
    "  - **Definition:** An object that maps keys to values with no duplicate keys.\n",
    "  - **Common Implementations:**  \n",
    "    - `HashMap` (unsorted, fast access via hashing)  \n",
    "    - `LinkedHashMap` (preserves insertion order)  \n",
    "    - `TreeMap` (sorted by keys)  \n",
    "  - **Key Methods:** `put()`, `get()`, `remove()`, `containsKey()`, `keySet()`"
