    "### Java Queues and Deques: In-Depth Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Is a Queue?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Queue** is a collection designed to hold elements prior to processing. It typically follows the **FIFO** (First-In-First-Out) principleâ€”elements that are inserted first are the ones that are removed first. Queues are especially useful for tasks such as job scheduling, handling requests in order, or managing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics of a Queue:**\n",
    "- **FIFO Order:** Items are processed in the order they were added.\n",
    "- **No Random Access:** Unlike lists, queues do not offer methods to access elements by an index.\n",
    "- **Basic Operations:** Include adding, peeking at, and removing elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What Is a Deque?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Deque** (double-ended queue) extends the functionality of a standard queue by allowing insertion and removal of elements at both the front and the back. This versatile data structure supports both FIFO (queue behavior) and LIFO (stack behavior) operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Characteristics of a Deque:**\n",
    "- **Double-Ended Operations:** You can add or remove elements from both ends.\n",
    "- **Flexible Order:** Can be used as a regular queue (FIFO) or a stack (LIFO) based on the operations you choose.\n",
    "- **No Indexed Access:** Similar to queues, deques do not support random access via indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Queue and Deque Implementations in Java\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **LinkedList**  \n",
    "   - **Description:** Implements both the `Queue` and `Deque` interfaces.  \n",
    "   - **Usage:** Suitable for basic FIFO queue operations and for scenarios that require double-ended operations.\n",
    "   - **Behavior:** Maintains the order of insertion, but does not provide random access.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **PriorityQueue**  \n",
    "   - **Description:** Implements the `Queue` interface, but orders its elements according to their natural order or a provided `Comparator`, rather than in FIFO order.\n",
    "   - **Usage:** Ideal for situations where elements need to be processed based on priority (e.g., shortest job first).\n",
    "   - **Limitation:** Does not support null values and the iteration order is not guaranteed to reflect the priority order.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ArrayDeque**  \n",
    "   - **Description:** A resizable array implementation of the `Deque` interface.\n",
    "   - **Usage:** Often recommended for deque implementations because of its efficiency. It can be used to implement both stack and queue behaviors.\n",
    "   - **Behavior:** Provides constant-time performance for adding and removing elements at both ends.\n",
    "   - **Limitation:** Not thread-safe by default; external synchronization or concurrent alternatives are needed in multi-threaded environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **ConcurrentLinkedQueue** (and **ConcurrentLinkedDeque**)  \n",
    "   - **Description:** Thread-safe implementations of the `Queue` and `Deque` interfaces found in the `java.util.concurrent` package.\n",
    "   - **Usage:** Suitable when multiple threads need to access and modify the queue concurrently.\n",
    "   - **Behavior:** Designed for high throughput in concurrent settings without locking the entire data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Operations on Queues and Deques\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For a **Queue**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Add Elements:**\n",
    "  - `boolean offer(E e)`: Inserts the specified element into the queue, returning `false` if the queue is bounded and there is no space.\n",
    "  - `boolean add(E e)`: Inserts the specified element; throws an exception if the element cannot be added.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Inspect Elements (without removal):**\n",
    "  - `E peek()`: Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of the queue; returns `null` if empty.\n",
    "  - `E element()`: Similar to `peek()` but throws an exception if the queue is empty.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Remove Elements:**\n",
    "  - `E poll()`: Retrieves and removes the head of the queue; returns `null` if the queue is empty.\n",
    "  - `E remove()`: Retrieves and removes the head; throws an exception if the queue is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For a **Deque**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Add Elements at Both Ends:**\n",
    "  - `void addFirst(E e)` / `boolean offerFirst(E e)`: Inserts the specified element at the front.\n",
    "  - `void addLast(E e)` / `boolean offerLast(E e)`: Inserts the specified element at the end.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Inspect Elements at Both Ends:**\n",
    "  - `E peekFirst()`: Retrieves but does not remove the first element; returns `null` if empty.\n",
    "  - `E peekLast()`: Retrieves but does not remove the last element; returns `null` if empty.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Remove Elements from Both Ends:**\n",
    "  - `E removeFirst()`: Removes and returns the first element; throws an exception if empty.\n",
    "  - `E removeLast()`: Removes and returns the last element; throws an exception if empty.\n",
    "  - `E pollFirst()`: Removes and returns the first element; returns `null` if empty.\n",
    "  - `E pollLast()`: Removes and returns the last element; returns `null` if empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Can and Cannot Do with Queues and Deques\n",
    "\n",
    "**You Can:**\n",
    "- **Maintain Order:** Use queues for FIFO processing of elements.\n",
    "- **Process by Priority:** Use `PriorityQueue` to process elements based on priority instead of insertion order.\n",
    "- **Add or Remove from Both Ends:** Use deques to flexibly operate at both the beginning and the end.\n",
    "- **Efficiently Manage Large Data:** Use concurrent versions for thread-safe operations in a multi-threaded environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You Cannot:**\n",
    "- **Randomly Access Elements:** Neither queues nor deques provide methods for accessing elements by index.\n",
    "- **Assume Ordering:** With standard queues (like `PriorityQueue`), iteration order is based on priority criteria, not necessarily the order of insertion.\n",
    "- **Store Nulls (in Some Implementations):** Implementations such as `PriorityQueue` do not permit null elements.\n",
