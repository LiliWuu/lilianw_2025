Also assigned homework for reinforcement. |\n",
    "| **Bathroom Queue & Hall Pass Management** | ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d98a9da2-6b0d-495f-afa1-6039a08c69b9) | Enhanced the bathroom pass and hall pass system to incorporate approval requests. Implemented retrieval of `timeIn` upon approval to track student movement. |\n",
