## Best Time to Visit
The best time to visit Bora Bora is during the dry season, which runs from May to October. During this period, you’ll experience pleasant temperatures between 23°C to 30°C (73°F to 86°F), lower humidity, and minimal rainfall. This is the ideal time for outdoor activities and enjoying the island’s stunning natural beauty. The wet season, from November to April, brings higher humidity and more frequent rain showers, though it can be a quieter time to visit with fewer tourists and potential for better deals on accommodations.
