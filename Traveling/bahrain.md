## Best Time to Visit
The best time to visit Bahrain is during the cooler months between November and March, when temperatures are more moderate, ranging from 15°C to 25°C (59°F to 77°F). During this period, outdoor activities are more comfortable, and the weather is pleasant for sightseeing. Summer months, especially between June and August, can be extremely hot, with temperatures often exceeding 40°C (104°F), making it less ideal for travelers who prefer mild weather.

- **Samboosa**: Similar to samosas, these crispy pastries are stuffed with spiced meat, vegetables, or cheese, and are popular as snacks or appetizers.
- **Halwa**: A sweet treat made with sugar, corn starch, saffron, and rose water, often enjoyed with Arabic coffee.
