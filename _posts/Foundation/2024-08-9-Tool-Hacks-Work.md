# Tool Installation 
## Shell Commands
Shell commands allow users to interact with the operating system through a **shell**. Some basic navigation commands that can be used through the terminal include:
- _ls_ - lists the files and directories in the current directory
- _cd_ <directory> - changes directories 
- _pwd_ - prints the path to the current working directory
- _mkdir_ <directory> - makes a new directory
- _rmdir_ <directory> - removes current directory
- _rm_ <file> - removes a file
- _mv_ <source> <destination> - moves a file or directory to a different location
<br></br>
**Homebrew** is a package manager for macOS that allows users to install software such as developer tools like Python, and Ruby. Some commands for Homebrew include: 
- _brew install <package>_ - installs a package using Homebrew
- _brew update_ - updates Homebrew

## Version Control
**Version control** manages changes to files by allowing the user to track and manage different versions of the files. **Git** is an example of a version control system. 
- To work with files in GitHub, a user would first need to clone the repository. The files from the repository would then be placed in a new folder on the user's local machine.
<br></br>
- To access the GitHub repositories, users can use the terminal and locate the files by using commands like cd to change into the directory with the repository
- I would update the template of the portfolio 2025 repository by adding a CSA submenu that has a timetable for all the units and timelines to keep track of my work. 
<br></br>
- After committing their project's changes in VSCode, the user would need to push their changes from their local machine to their remote repository in GitHub through _git push_

## Localhost vs. Deployed Server
- The difference between viewing GitHub Pages running on my localhost machine versus running on a deployed server is that the localhost URL for my project is only accessible by me, while the Github Pages URL can be viewed by anyone with the URL.

## DNS and GitHub Pages
- The default domain for GitHub Pages is typically: "https://<username>.github.io/<repository<repository>>/"
- The URL for my GitHub Pages is different from my neighbor's URLs because we all have different usernames and repository names

# Tools Verification Hacks
## Verify Installation
- I ran basic commands like git --version, python --version

- I downloaded the latest version of python but when I typed python --version in the terminal, it returned Python 3.11.5, but when I typed python3.12 --version in the terminal, it returned Python 3.12.5 (which was the python version I downloaded).

## GitHub Usage with VSCode


## Brief Definitions
- Git: A distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each otherâ€™s changes.
- GitLens: A powerful extension for VSCode that provides insights into Git repositories. It helps visualize code authorship, track changes, and understand the history and evolution of a codebase.
